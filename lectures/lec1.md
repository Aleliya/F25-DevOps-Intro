# 📌Lecture 1 - Introduction to DevOps

## 📍 Slide 1 – 🚀 What is DevOps?

* 🧩 **Definition**: DevOps = **Development (👨‍💻 Dev)** + **Operations (⚙️ Ops)**.
* 🎯 **Purpose**: A cultural and technical movement to deliver applications **faster**, **more reliable**, and **securely**.
* 🏗️ **Not only tools** → it is **culture, mindset, and practices**.
* 🔄 **Extension of Agile (⚡)** → applies Agile principles beyond coding into **deployment, monitoring, and feedback**.
* 💡 **Key idea**: Treat infrastructure and delivery pipelines as **products**, not afterthoughts.

## 📍 Slide 2 – 📜 A Brief History of DevOps

* 🕰️ **Pre-2007**: “Wall of confusion” between **Dev teams (new features)** and **Ops teams (stability)**.
* 💡 **2007–2008**: Ideas of “Agile Infrastructure” and “Agile Systems Administration”.
* 🎤 **2009**: Patrick Debois organizes **first DevOpsDays** in Belgium.
* 🌍 **2010–2012**: DevOpsDays events spread globally, the word “DevOps” becomes mainstream.
* 🏢 Early adopters: **Amazon (📦)**, **Netflix (🎬)**, **Google (🔎)**.

⚡ **Historical fact**: At Amazon, a developer could take **weeks** to deploy. After adopting DevOps → **minutes**.

---

## 📍 Slide 5 – 🔑 Core Principles: The CAMS Model

* 🌱 **C = Culture** → trust, collaboration, shared responsibility.
* 🤖 **A = Automation** → eliminate manual, error-prone work.
* 📊 **M = Measurement** → track performance with metrics:

  * ⏱️ **MTTR = Mean Time to Recovery** (how fast systems recover).
  * ❌ **CFR = Change Failure Rate** (percentage of failed changes).
* 🔗 **S = Sharing** → knowledge, successes, and failures → **blameless postmortems**.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

  Dev[👨‍💻 Developers] --> Culture[🌱 DevOps Culture]
  Ops[⚙️ Operations] --> Culture
  QA[🧪 QA] --> Culture
  Sec[🔒 Security] --> Culture
  Culture --> Success[🚀 Success Together]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 7 – 🔄 Shift-Left Mindset

* ⏪ **Definition**: Moving testing & security **earlier** in the development cycle.
* 🧪 **Continuous testing** → run unit/integration tests at each commit.
* 🔒 **Security shift-left** → static analysis (SAST), dependency scans before deployment.
* 📊 **Benefits**: Catch bugs early, reduce fix cost, speed releases.

**YAML Example (GitHub Action – security scan):**

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run dependency check
        run: npm audit   # 🔒 Scans for vulnerabilities
```

---

## 📍 Slide 8 – 👥 Collaboration Between Teams

* 🧩 **Breaking silos** → Dev + Ops + QA + Security work **together**.
* 📡 **Tools**: Slack (💬), Jira (📑), Confluence (📚).
* 🏃 **DevOps + Agile** → combine Scrum ceremonies with continuous delivery.
* 📈 **Outcome**: Faster decisions, fewer blockers, stronger trust.
